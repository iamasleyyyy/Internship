          <li>Internship at Aguilla Holdings</li>
          <p> 
            My internship at Aguila gave me practical experience in real-world software development.
             I collaborated with the tech team on frontend tasks, learned how to work with Git/GitHub, and contributed to improving the user experience on several web pages.
             I also developed stronger problem-solving skills by fixing bugs, optimizing code, and participating in team discussions.

          <li>Photographer–Ghana Police Church</li>
            <p>  
                As a photographer for the Ghana Police Church , I capture high-quality photos during church services, programs, and special events.
                My role involves documenting key moments, supporting event coverage, and ensuring all media content reflects the church’s standards.
                I have strengthened my skills in event photography, live streaming, lighting, and photo editing, while collaborating closely with the media team to create engaging visual content.
                This experience has improved my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to work efficiently in fast-paced environments.

            <p>
            As a member of the Computer Science Association (COMPSSA) at the University of Ghana, I actively participate in tech talks and networking events with industry professionals.
            Through the association, I engage in coding workshops, hands-on training sessions, and seminars on emerging technologies such as AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.
            I also collaborate with peers on mini-projects, problem-solving activities, and knowledge-sharing discussions that help strengthen my technical skills and broaden my understanding of the tech industry.
